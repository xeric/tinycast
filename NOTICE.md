# Third-party notices

Tinycast is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). It
also redistributes the third-party material recorded below, under the terms stated for each.

## Brand marks — `Tinycast/Assets.xcassets/AIBrand*.imageset`

Sixteen monochrome template SVGs, ~300 B–2 KB each, drawn beside a model's name in the model
picker and the chat header, and beside a provider in Settings, so a route is recognisable at a
glance.

Every mark is the trademark of the company it identifies. Tinycast uses them only to name that
company's own models inside its own UI. No affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement is implied, and
none of these companies has reviewed or approved Tinycast.

### Simple Icons — thirteen marks

`claude`, `cursor`, `deepseek`, `googlegemini`, `kimi`, `meta`, `minimax`, `mistralai`, `openai`,
`openrouter`, `perplexity`, `qwen` and `x`, from <https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons>.

The Simple Icons **project** is released under CC0 1.0 Universal. Its own disclaimer is explicit
that this does not extend to every mark the project carries: the icons depict third-party brands
whose trademarks stay with their owners, and the absence of licence data for a given icon does not
imply the icon is unlicensed. Anyone redistributing Tinycast, or reusing these files from it,
should read the disclaimer and satisfy themselves about the brands involved:
<https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/DISCLAIMER.md>.

### Lobe Icons — two marks

`grok` and `zai`, from <https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons>, which is MIT licensed. Its licence requires
this notice to travel with the work:

### OpenCode — one mark

`opencode`, drawn after the mark in <https://github.com/sst/opencode>, which is MIT licensed: the
frame and the dimmer block inside it, as its own favicon has them. Its licence requires this notice
to travel with the work:

## Rooms — window rooms, their layouts and the gliding layout preview

Window Management's rooms adapt code from **Rooms** by Sara Gordić,
<https://github.com/saragordic/rooms>, used with the author's permission and under its MIT
licence. The room model, the layout and grid engines, arrangement reading, window matching,
parking and its ledger, the pass that walks into a room, and the animated layout preview all
follow that project. Every adapted file says so on its first line, with a link to the licence:

- `Tinycast/Features/WindowManagement/Model/`: `Room.swift`, `RoomWindow.swift`,
  `RoomLayoutKind.swift`, `RoomLayoutEngine.swift`, `RoomGrid.swift`, `RoomArrangement.swift`,
  `RoomWindowMatcher.swift`, `RoomParking.swift`, `RoomParkingLedger.swift`, `RoomPlan.swift` and
  `RoomMinimumSizeStore.swift`
- `Tinycast/Features/WindowManagement/Service/`: `RoomRunner.swift`, `RoomWindowSweep.swift`, and
  the window-number lookup in `AXWindowAccess.swift`
- `Tinycast/Features/WindowManagement/UI/`: `RoomCoordinator.swift`, `RoomsScreen.swift`,
  `RoomPickerScreen.swift`, `RoomPreviewController.swift` and `RoomPreviewView.swift`
- `Tests/window-room-test.swift`, whose cases follow Rooms' own tests
